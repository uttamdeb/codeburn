# Claude

Anthropic Claude Code CLI and Claude Desktop's local agent mode.

- **Source:** `src/providers/claude.ts`
- **Loading:** eager (`src/providers/index.ts:1`)
- **Test:** none directly. Coverage comes from `tests/parser-claude-cwd.test.ts`, `tests/parser-filter.test.ts`, and `tests/parser-mcp-inventory.test.ts`, which exercise `src/parser.ts` end-to-end against fixture session files.

## Where it reads from

| Source | Path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code CLI | `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` if set, otherwise `~/.claude/projects/` |
| Claude Desktop (macOS) | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/` |
| Claude Desktop (Windows, classic) | `%APPDATA%/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/` |
| Claude Desktop (Windows, MSIX) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Packages/<Claude package>/LocalCache/Roaming/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/` |
| Claude Desktop (Linux) | `~/.config/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/` |

For Desktop, `findDesktopProjectDirs` walks up to 8 levels deep looking for `projects/` subdirectories, skipping `node_modules` and `.git`.

Desktop session roots are resolved in this order:

1. A non-empty `CODEBURN_DESKTOP_SESSIONS_DIR` overrides discovery and is the
   only returned root.
2. macOS uses the single path shown above.
3. Windows always includes the classic path first. It then scans
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%/Packages` for package directories whose names start with
   `Claude_` or contain `.Claude_`, sorted by package name, and includes only
   packages whose full MSIX sessions path exists as a directory.
4. Other platforms use the single Linux path shown above.

All returned roots are absolute, resolved, and deduplicated. Missing or
unreadable Windows package directories are ignored.

## Storage format

JSONL, one event per line, per session file. Sessions live under `<project>/<sessionId>.jsonl`.

## Parser

`createSessionParser` returns an empty async generator (`claude.ts:101-105`). Claude is a special case: `src/parser.ts` reads Claude JSONL files directly with full turn grouping, dedup of streaming message IDs, and MCP tool inventory extraction. The provider object exists only so `discoverSessions` can return Claude session sources alongside the others.

Claude Code can record a message sent while it is working as an
`attachment` entry with `attachment.type: "queued_command"` and
`commandMode: "prompt"`. CodeBurn counts a timestamped, non-empty prompt as a
new user turn and assigns later assistant API calls to it. Task notifications,
IDE or system-reminder injections, slash commands, and other attachment types
are ignored, as are peer and agent-message queued commands
(`isMeta: true`/`origin.kind: "peer"`), which are queue plumbing rather than a
prompt the user typed. Turns represent API usage, so a queued prompt with no following
assistant API call is omitted, just like an ordinary user message with no
assistant call.

Ordinary `user` records marked `isMeta: true`, `isCompactSummary: true`, or with
an `origin.kind` other than `human` are also harness records. They do not split
the active human turn; assistant API calls after them remain billed under that
turn, or under an implicit usage-bearing turn when the transcript has no human
prompt yet. The parser uses these recorded fields for attribution and does not
guess from slash-prefixed text, which can contain a real filesystem path.

## Pricing

Claude Code reports total cache-write tokens in `usage.cache_creation_input_tokens`.
When available, it also splits those writes by duration in
`usage.cache_creation.ephemeral_5m_input_tokens` and
`usage.cache_creation.ephemeral_1h_input_tokens`. CodeBurn keeps the existing
aggregate cache-write token total for reports, but prices the 1-hour portion at
2x base input cost (1.6x the 5-minute cache-write rate exposed by LiteLLM).
If the split fields are missing, the parser falls back to the legacy behavior
and prices every cache write at the 5-minute rate.

## Bedrock sessions

The JSONL has no provider field; the only trace of how a call was billed is
the model id. With `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` the assistant messages record
Bedrock's id — `anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`, or with the
cross-region profile prefix the user configured, `us.anthropic.…` — where a
direct-API session records `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. `getModelRoute` reads
the shape, so the rows are `Haiku 4.5`, `Haiku 4.5 (Bedrock)` and
`Haiku 4.5 (Bedrock us)`: three SKUs at three prices, kept apart on every
surface (see "Model rows and billing routes" in `../architecture.md`). Vertex
ids (`claude-…@20251001`) are not a route yet; the `@` suffix is stripped and
they merge with the direct row.

## Caching

None at the provider level. The daily aggregation cache (`src/daily-cache.ts`) reuses prior computed days.

## Quirks

- The parser is in `src/parser.ts`, not in `src/providers/claude.ts`. Anything that changes Claude parsing belongs in `parser.ts`.
- Streaming responses produce duplicate message IDs across resumed sessions; `parser.ts` strips them via the global `seenMsgIds` Set.
- Model display names are mapped in `claude.ts:7-20`; add new versions there when Anthropic releases them.

## Early quota resets

Anthropic sometimes resets a usage window before its scheduled time. The menubar
notices on the existing refresh lifecycle — no extra request — by comparing each
fetch's windows against the previous fetch's readings, which are kept per window
in `UserDefaults` alongside the record of what has already been announced.
Everything is local; nothing is fetched to produce it. A detected reset posts one
system notification and nothing else: there is no persistent UI for it.

The detection is deliberately quiet. It needs a validated window length (the
fixed 5-hour and 7-day limits), a stored reset that has not yet passed, and
either a reset time anchored to a genuinely new cycle or a fall of at least 40
points that lands at or under 10%. A scheduled reset, a plan change, clock or
timestamp skew, a window appearing or disappearing, a first observation and a
reconnect after a terminal failure all produce nothing.

## When fixing a bug here

1. Confirm whether the bug is in **discovery** (sessions not picked up) or **parsing** (sessions found but data wrong).
2. Discovery bugs live in `claude.ts:78-99`. Verify the directory layout you expect actually matches what Claude writes today.
3. Parsing bugs live in `src/parser.ts`. Look for `parseSessionFile`, `groupIntoTurns`, and `dedupeStreamingMessageIds`.
4. Add a fixture under `tests/fixtures/` and a test under `tests/parser-claude-cwd.test.ts` (or a new file). Do not mock the filesystem.
