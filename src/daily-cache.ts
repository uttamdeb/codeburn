// Bumped to 27: claude-haiku-4.5 copilot store rows now price correctly (alias added) — #1093.
// Previously the raw id 'claude-haiku-4.5' (tier-first, dot) from session-store.db had no
// pricing alias, so days finalized with this model were stuck at $0. No self-heal via prefix
// fallback exists for this id, so a version bump is required to force re-derivation.
// Bumped to 26: copilot input/cache tokens for sessions covered by the CLI's
// session-store.db move from one shutdown-rollup lump (stamped at session end)
// to per-request DB rows with real timestamps, supplementary accounting calls
// (rollups, residuals, paired rows) stop counting as api/model calls, and
// reasoning tokens leave the copilot cost recompute (they are inside the
// output the per-turn calls already bill). Per-day attribution, call counts and
// costs all move, so days finalized under an earlier version would disagree
// with the live parse.
//
// Why 26 and not 21 (the number this change first claimed): 20 is #1040 (codex
// model attribution), 18 was burned by an earlier public head of THIS change
// under different accounting, and 21-25 landed on main while this branch was in
// validation — 25 in particular was spent by #1056 (`codex-auto-review`
// pricing) after this PR had already minted it, which is why the number moves
// again here. 26 is the first free number on main's ladder — and it is load
// bearing beyond the collision: the branch's own validators already hold
// daily-cache.v21.json files whose copilot slices were carried stale by the
// bug PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS fixes below, and only a number those files
// cannot claim gets them re-derived. isMigratableCache/adoptOlderDailyCaches
// carry a same-or-newer version forward as FINALIZED without re-deriving it,
// so a number can never mean two accountings. (feat/core-extraction also sits
// at 26 and reconciles at its final merge by keeping the max.)
//
// Bumped to 25: `codex-auto-review` now prices as the recommended GPT-5.5
// row (#1047). Days already finalized under v24 keep that id at $0
// forever unless MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION moves: the daily cache has no
// per-provider invalidation. The Codex parse version and CODEX_CACHE_VERSION
// move with this so the lower caches reprice first; this pass then re-derives
// ALL days from the warm session cache (seconds, not a full re-parse).
// adoptOlderDailyCaches keeps the superseded file as the baseline. v21 is
// #946, v22 was this PR's earlier claim, v23 is #1075, v24 is #1090.
//
// Bumped to 20: the Codex fast-path read a nested
// `base_instructions.provenance.model` out of `session_meta` as if it were
// `payload.model` (#1040), so every call a rollout attributed from session
// metadata - the ones before its first `turn_context`, and every one after a
// mid-file `session_meta` - was credited to the wrong model. The codex parse
// version and CODEX_CACHE_VERSION move with it, but the daily cache has no
// per-provider invalidation, so days already finalized keep the wrong model
// rows forever unless MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION moves too. This pass re-derives
// ALL days for EVERY provider off the warm session cache, so it costs seconds
// rather than a full re-parse, and it is lossless: adoptOlderDailyCaches keeps
// the superseded v19 file as the baseline, and the partial-survival guard from
// #1033 holds any day whose sources have only partly aged out. On a real
// 110-day cache the 19 -> 20 pass moved ZERO days down and lost none: 100 days
// came back byte-identical and 9 grok days rose by $19.80 in total, clearing
// rollups the grok parse change had left stale, while every codex model row
// stayed identical (that corpus predates the `provenance` field, so the fix it
// carries has nothing to correct there).
//
// Bumped to 19: Grok authoritative usage now keeps one session-level rollup
// from top-level totals, clamps reasoning to reported output, and labels mixed
// authoritative/heuristic coverage. Every day finalized under the previous
// accounting carries the old Grok totals, and the daily cache has no
// per-provider invalidation, so raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION is the only
// lever: it forces a one-time re-derivation of ALL days, for every provider,
// not just Grok. That pass reads the warm session cache (CACHE_VERSION is
// unchanged and only PROVIDER_PARSE_VERSIONS.grok moved), so it costs seconds
// rather than a full re-parse, and adoptOlderDailyCaches keeps the superseded
// file as the baseline for days no source can still re-derive. Days whose
// sources only PARTLY survive are held by the partial-survival guard in
// mergeDayEntries, which is what makes a global re-derive safe to force: on a
// real 108-day cache the 17 -> 19 pass moves Grok cost and tokens and nothing
// else - the day-by-day call counts come back identical.
//
// The shipped predecessor is v17; v18 was an unreleased draft of this change
// and only exists in pre-release checkouts. 19 clears both.
//
// Bumped to 17: copilot CLI sessions were misclassified as VS Code transcripts
// (#944), so days finalized at v16 or earlier carry output-only copilot costs —
// the session.shutdown rollup's input/cache tokens were dropped. Raising
// MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time re-derivation under the
// provenance-based classification; sourceless days carry forward as-is.
//
// v16: Codex discovery is structural instead of originator-gated
// (#873/#626), so rollouts written by third-party frontends driving
// `codex app-server` ("t3code_desktop", "JetBrains.IntelliJ IDEA", ...) now
// contribute usage that v15 rollups never contained. Those files were rejected
// before they were ever parsed, so nothing downstream can notice on its own:
// `usage-aggregator` serves every day before today from this cache, and
// retention is ten years, so an upgrading user with a warm cache would keep the
// pre-fix history forever while today's numbers silently disagreed with it.
// Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time re-derivation.
//
// v15: per-project daily rollups. Days and provider slices now carry
// a `projects` breakdown (cost/calls/savings/sessions per project) so project
// history outlives the session files, like models and categories already do.
// This bump is the first to ride the v14 carry-forward: the old cache is
// adopted losslessly and only days whose sources survive are re-derived (now
// with projects); days already sourceless keep their totals and simply have
// no project split.
//
// v14: NEVER-LOSE history. Session files are ephemeral (Claude Code
// deletes transcripts after ~30 days), so a day that can no longer be re-derived
// from sources exists ONLY in this cache. Every earlier version treated the
// cache as disposable — schema bumps, savings-config changes, timezone changes
// and incomplete-hydration retries all dropped the days and re-derived from
// whatever sources survived, silently truncating history to the source-retention
// window (five bumps between 2026-06-22 and 2026-07-16 erased everything before
// 2026-04-24 on a machine with usage since March). From v14 on, invalidation
// re-derives what it can and CARRIES FORWARD every (day, provider) slice it
// cannot, and loading a missing/unsupported cache file adopts days from every
// older daily-cache file in the cache dir instead of starting empty. Bumping
// the version now only forces re-derivation of days whose sources still exist;
// it must never again lose the rest. DailyEntry.providers slices carry a full
// per-provider breakdown (tokens, models, categories) so those carry-forwards
// stay exact across rebuilds.
//
// v13: day bucketing is now TURN-anchored (a turn's whole cost/calls
// land on the day of its user-message timestamp) to match the live headline/
// report rollup. v12 bucketed each call by its own timestamp, so a midnight-
// straddling turn split across two days and history.daily / the provider
// breakdown never reconciled to current.cost. Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION
// forces the one-time re-hydration that rebuilds history under turn bucketing.
//
// v12: CodeWhale support adds historical usage that earlier rollups
// did not contain. Both the CodeWhale branch and the kiro credit-pricing
// change (below) claimed v11 independently, so v12 is the first version that
// contains both; raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time
// re-hydration for days finalized at either v11.
//
// v11: kiro cost accounting changed (metered credits pass through
// the session cache instead of being re-priced from estimated tokens), so
// days finalized at v10 carry token-estimated kiro costs that were off by up
// to 16× per model. Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time full
// re-hydration that backfills history under credit-based pricing.
//
// v10: cursor accounting changed (real composer context tokens on
// conversation-anchored records, Cursor-published composer pricing), so days
// finalized at v9 carry the old double-counted agentKv estimates and
// sonnet-proxy composer costs.
//
// v9: providers added since the v8 rollup (Grok, Hermes, ZCode) parse usage
// that older binaries skipped. v8 added local-model savings to the daily
// rollup; the `savingsConfigHash` field is invalidated separately when the
// user changes their `localModelSavings` mapping.
// v23: codex pricing fix (#1075) - reasoning tokens were billed on top of
// output (they are a subset of it) and cache_write_input_tokens was ignored, so
// days finalized at v20 carry codex costs overstated by ~3.5% and codex output
// tokens overstated by ~34.6%. Raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the
// one-time re-derivation.
// It takes 23, not 21: v21 is claimed by the #946 landing branch and v22 by
// PR #1056, so those numbers are spoken for and reusing one would let two
// incompatible schemas share a filename. (feat/core-extraction sits at 26 and
// reconciles at its final merge by keeping the max.)
//
// v24: gpt-5.6-codex / gpt-5.6-codex-max pricing (#1077) - added as explicit
// litellm-snapshot.json rows. getModelCosts already resolved both ids to the
// correct rate via the `gpt-5.6` prefix fallback before this landed, so a day
// finalized on any binary that had a `gpt-5.6` snapshot row already carries
// the right cost; this bump only matters for a day finalized before THAT (a
// window where neither existed). The daily cache has no per-provider
// invalidation, so there is no way to tell those days apart from here -
// raising MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION forces the one-time re-derivation for
// everyone, which is a lossless no-op for days already correct.
// v25: #1047 activity-id pricing. v24 on main already shipped #1090.
// v26: #946 copilot session-store accounting (see the top of this ladder).
// v27: #1093 claude-haiku-4.5 alias (see top).
// v28: #1115 report/optimize output tokens go through billableOutputTokens.
// Exclusive providers (Grok and the rest) were under-counted by reasoningTokens
// in finalized daily rows; inclusive {claude,codex,copilot} were correct there
// but optimize added reasoning again. Re-derive so report matches the live parse.
// v29: #1118 OrcaRouter route pricing (fusion aliases + peel; auto stays unpriced).
// v28 on main already shipped #1115.
// v31: Hermes cost provenance. Subscription-included sessions stay $0,
// explicit estimates retain their status, and surviving Hermes sources replace
// v29 slices produced by the old API-equivalent fallback.
// 31: #1234 Hermes cost contract; 30 is claimed by #1132.
// v32: DSH session formats v1-v3 and inclusive reasoning accounting. Re-derive
// finalized DSH days so migrated generations and retry attempts replace the
// v0-only totals, and reasoning detail is not added on top of full output.
// v33: #1450 billing routes. `day.models` is keyed by modelRowKey (display
// name + route label) instead of the raw provider id, so a route the provider
// recorded in its own column (Hermes `billing_provider`) survives into the
// finalized day; the raw id alone cannot carry it. A v32 day holds raw ids,
// which re-derive to the same rows for direct calls and to "(Bedrock)" rows
// for Bedrock-shaped ids, but its Hermes column routes are unrecoverable
// without a re-parse, so hermes joins PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS.
// v34: Warp cost accounting changed the same way kiro's did at v11 - Warp's
// own billing record (provider cost / charged usage / metered credits) now
// passes through the session cache instead of being re-priced from the token
// floor, which understated or overstated every Warp day. Days finalized at v33
// carry the floor figure; the bump re-derives those whose Warp conversations
// still exist (Warp's sqlite is durable, so effectively all of them) and
// carries the rest forward untouched. Call counts are unchanged, so no
// PENDING_REDERIVE entry is needed and the partial-survival guard is unaffected.
// v35: a non-Anthropic model with no published cache-write rate now bills
// cache-write tokens at its input rate instead of a fabricated 1.25x. Days
// finalized at v34 overstate those tokens; the bump re-derives surviving days.
// v36: Cursor Agent counts every assistant message of an agentic loop, not
// just the first after each user message, and bills tool_use inputs and the
// full user text. Days finalized at v35 hold a fraction of those calls; the
// provider parse version alone re-parses sessions but never reopens a
// finalized day, so the bump re-derives surviving days. Call counts only
// rise, so no PENDING_REDERIVE entry is needed.
// v37: #1547 OpenCode/KiloCode. A turn CodeBurn cannot price keeps the cost
// OpenCode recorded instead of $0, and Vertex turns land on a "(Vertex)" row.
// Days finalized at v36 hold $0 and the unrouted row; the bump re-derives
// surviving days. Call counts are unchanged.
// v38: #1529 Copilot OTel conversations land on their VS Code workspace
// instead of `copilot-chat`. Only the per-project split moves; cost, tokens and
// calls are unchanged. Settled days keep the old split unless they re-derive,
// and the session cache still holds their calls, so the bump re-derives them.
// Calls whose spans were already pruned from agent-traces.db keep the old
// label: the copilot re-parse only replaces calls the DB still holds.
// v39: #986 Cursor Agent reads CLI sessions that exist only in
// ~/.cursor/chats/*/*/store.db. Days finalized at v38 miss those calls; the
// bump re-derives surviving days. Call counts only rise.
// v40: Codex fork usage after the copied-history burst was clipped by the old
// 5s window. Re-derive Codex slices from the updated session cache so settled
// days recover those calls and tokens.
// v41: OMP side calls (`model_usage` entries: find, judge, cache warming) now
// count. Days finalized at v40 miss them; the bump re-derives surviving days.
// Call counts and cost only rise.
// v42: #1076 long-context tiers. A Codex call past a model's published
// long-context threshold prices at the tier rate, so settled days re-derive.
// v43: Codex response-level token_usage_record repairs compacted/interrupted
// responses and suppresses stale token_count twins. Counts can rise or fall,
// so re-derive surviving days and allow the Codex slice to shrink once.
// v44: Claude queued_command human prompts split and reclassify turns. Calls
// and tokens are unchanged, but settled category totals need re-derivation.
// v45: #1581 ZCode user prompt text now reaches classification. Calls and
// cost are unchanged, but settled zcode category totals need re-derivation.
// v46: Devin usage comes from sessions.db instead of the transcript exports,
// which held a few sessions and dated steps without metadata.created_at on the
// session's last activity. Days finalized at v45 miss most Devin calls, and a
// day can also lose calls that now land on their real date, so devin joins
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS.
// v47: Copilot chat-session journals read request-level promptTokens, repairing
// missing input usage and input-only calls. Re-derive settled days from the
// corrected session cache; calls and cost only rise.
// v48: #1620 Antigravity manage_task/search_web/read_url_content/invoke_subagent
// reclassify turns. Calls and cost are unchanged, but settled antigravity
// category totals need re-derivation.
// v49: Crush's recorded cumulative session cost now passes through the session
// cache instead of being re-priced from its non-cumulative token counters. Days
// finalized before v49 hold the re-priced figure with unchanged call counts, so the
// read path's equal-call rule keeps them; the bump re-derives surviving days.
// Call counts are unchanged, so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is
// needed.
// v50: Hermes uses its native Windows LOCALAPPDATA root; finalized days can
// miss sessions there and must be re-derived after the default path is fixed.
// v51: honor redirected Copilot and Cursor editor data roots. Backfill settled
// days that previously missed usage stored under APPDATA or XDG_CONFIG_HOME.
// v52: DSH session format v4 (dsh 0.2.0-rc.2) is read; days finalized while
// those sessions were skipped re-derive. Calls only rise, so no
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v53: #1616 Codex priority-tier pricing. Turns run under Codex's Fast speed
// setting bill at the published priority rates (2x on most gpt-5/6 rows, 2.5x
// on gpt-5.5; per-row, derived from LiteLLM's priority keys), so settled days
// under-price them; the bump re-derives surviving days off the warm session
// cache. MIN_SUPPORTED_VERSION stays at 28 (#1478's convention: a version bump
// alone re-derives warm caches, so raising the floor buys nothing).
// v54: `codex-auto-review` prices as gpt-5.4 before 30 Jul 2026 and GPT-5.6
// Luna from then on (OpenAI's auto-review move), not gpt-5.5, so settled days
// over-price it. Only cost falls; call counts are unchanged, so no
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v55: Codex service_tier "flex" bills at the published Flex rates instead of
// standard, and `gpt-reserve` / `gpt-5.3-spark` price as GPT-5.6 Luna / GPT-5.3
// Codex Spark instead of $0. Only cost moves; call counts are unchanged, so no
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v56: Copilot assistant.message events with no outputTokens (CLI 1.0.8x, the
// VS Code agent host) count as calls, and their shutdown rollup (or, under
// session-store rows, its residual) carries the output it previously dropped.
// Settled days re-derive. Calls only rise, except a store row and its message
// straddling midnight, which moves one call to the next day; copilot's
// PENDING_REDERIVE contract moves to 56 so that day may shrink once.
// v57: Copilot session-store rows carry their own output where no per-turn call
// does, so a session that never wrote session.shutdown (ACP hosts such as
// JetBrains AI Chat) counts its output, and grok-4.6 prices at xAI's $2/M input
// instead of Azure's $1.25/M. Output and cost only rise; call counts are
// unchanged, so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v58: Cursor Agent transcript turns are dated by their prompt's <timestamp>
// tag instead of the session's last write. Settled days re-derive; a session
// that crossed midnight moves calls to an earlier day, so cursor-agent joins
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS at 58.
// v59: Antigravity reads cache-read tokens from gen_metadata and the RPC usage,
// and the standalone app's placeholder-only model (MODEL_PLACEHOLDER_M16, stored
// as "gemini-pro-default") prices as gemini-3.1-pro-high instead of $0, with
// the above-200k tier. Cache read and cost only rise. Standalone rows without
// created_at move from the file-mtime day to their first step's day, so a
// session that crossed midnight moves calls to an earlier day, and antigravity
// joins PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS at 59.
// v60: Mistral Vibe 2.26 Unified Harness sessions (`unified/<id>/`) are read;
// days finalized while they were skipped re-derive. Calls only rise, so no
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v61: #1579 Claude Desktop usage-ledger records (Claude-3p Cowork and Code)
// are read and de-duplicated against matching transcript calls. Calls only
// rise, so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v62: Devin's SWE-2 prices at Cognition's list rate and swe-1-7-lightning as
// swe-1.7-lightning instead of $0. Only cost rises; call counts are unchanged,
// so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v63: Cline CLI input tokens include cache reads and writes, which were then
// billed again at the cache rates. Only input tokens and estimated cost fall;
// call counts are unchanged, so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is
// needed.
// v64: Kimi Code's `kimi-for-coding` prices by the model it served on the call's
// date (K2.5, K2.6, K2.7 Code) instead of retired K2 Thinking, and
// `kimi-for-coding-highspeed` prices at K2.7 Code HighSpeed instead of $0.
// From 11 Sep 2026 the alias served K2.8 Preview, which has no published rate;
// those calls price as K2.7 Code and are marked estimated.
// Calls are unchanged, so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v65: Grok Build reads per-request usage from logs/unified.jsonl and uses it
// in place of a session dir's one-call rollup for every session the log holds;
// days finalized without it re-derive. A logged session's single rollup call,
// dated at its last activity, becomes one call per request dated at that
// request, so a session that crossed midnight moves calls to an earlier day and
// grok joins PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS at 65.
// v66: Codex fork replay bursts drop only records found in the parent rollout;
// burst records the parent kept only inside a running total now count. Calls
// only rise, so no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v67: a day's project split is keyed per (label, path) instead of per label,
// which kept only the first path a label showed that day and handed the whole
// label (e.g. every home-folder Claude session) to whichever project owned it.
// Day and provider totals are unchanged, only the split inside them moves, so
// no PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed.
// v68: Kimi Code sessions whose state.json carries `cwd` but no `workDir` land
// on that folder. Only the per-project split moves; cost, tokens and calls are
// unchanged, so the bump re-derives surviving days.
// v69: Claude calls go to the project of their own cwd, so a session that
// moved folders splits across projects per call. Settled days re-derive their
// project rows; provider call counts and cost are unchanged, so no
// PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS entry is needed. Days whose transcripts
// are gone keep their old single-project attribution.
// v70: a day's project entry records the `origin` remote of its checkout, so
// clones and worktrees of one repository still group once the folder is
// deleted. Totals and the split are unchanged; surviving days re-derive to
// pick it up, carried days stay as they were.
// v71: a Cursor usage import that landed while the running binary had no
// daily-cache file of its own skipped its invalidation, so adoption carried the
// local Cursor estimates back and the guard kept them over the imported events,
// which are fewer calls. cursor joins PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS at 71.
// v72: on days a Cursor import fully covers, the parse produces no local
// cursor-agent (or Grok Bot, when the import holds its rows) slice, so the
// merge carried the old one on top of the imported rows. Adoption and the
// complete re-derive now drop those slices; the bump repairs carried days.
// v73: cursor-agent skips agent transcripts of Cursor IDE chats, which the
// cursor provider already counts from the IDE database. Those calls leave
// cursor-agent, so it joins PENDING_REDERIVE_PROVIDER_VERSIONS at 73.
// v74: discover OpenClaw's configured state directory and effective home.
// Finalized days may have omitted those sessions before the root override fix.
